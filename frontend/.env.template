# Environment Variables Template - FRONTEND

## Required Environment Variables

Copy this to your Vercel frontend project settings:

```env
# Backend API URL (Your backend Vercel deployment URL)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.vercel.app/api
```

## How to Get Backend URL

1. Deploy your backend first (see `.agent/workflows/deploy.md`)
2. Copy the deployment URL from Vercel (e.g., `https://paths-dashboard-backend.vercel.app`)
3. Add `/api` at the end
4. Paste the complete URL as `VITE_API_URL`

## Example

If your backend deploys to:
```
https://intern-management-api.vercel.app
```

Then set:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://intern-management-api.vercel.app/api
```

## Security Notes

- ✅ This URL is public (it's used by the browser)
- ✅ CORS protection is handled on the backend
- ⚠️ Never put sensitive keys in frontend environment variables
